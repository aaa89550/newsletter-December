                                    Children are frequently described as the future of our country. And yet the question of how they might some day contribute to the world is complex, delicate, and deeply intertwined with politics and history. Even adults struggle to know how to cope with, let alone solve, all the world’s problems. How, then, can adults guide children to engage with the world’s injustices?
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    Children’s books provide a powerful way for parents and children to reflect together on political issues that may be divisive, sensitive, overwhelming, or raw. In this newsletter, we introduce books from Taiwan that provoke such reflection. Some are tender, others allegorical; all approach political and social themes astutely. Perhaps the authors created these books not only for children, but also for their fellow adults, for whom it’s easier to avoid having to think about complicated topics.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    These picture books invite readers to reconsider the world we live in. Through shared reading, they offer a space for dialogue; in the process, children may reveal perspectives and insights even more valuable than our own.

We had a wonderful time at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL), and it was a joy to connect with so many of you there! Also, if you are going to the book fairs in Taipei or Bologna, we’d love to meet up! You can reply to this email.

                                    The first book we’d like to share is <em>PEOPLE</em>, a story about individuality and enforced unity. President Giraffe decrees that everything be painted yellow, a color he believes symbolizes hope. Factories, flags, and daily life are all reduced to a single color. This book encourages parents and children to consider together the importance of preserving, rather than erasing, difference. It uses color—a primal lens through which kids see the world—as a powerful metaphor for totalitarian control.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    <em>Beyond the Page</em> begins with a familiar act: opening a book. The story gradually uncovers Taiwan’s past under martial law and the White Terror, illustrating how censorship permeated daily life. In this world, books had to be hidden for the stories to survive. Through poetic, dreamlike scenes, this book evokes the lived experience of fear and silence. It traces how memory and imagination persist even when freedom is taken away.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    In <em>Smokestack Story</em>, a wealthy man enjoys a comfortable life made possible by smokestacks. These smokestacks generate the energy that allows him to produce and consume whatever he desires. But the smoke smells unpleasant and makes him cough, so he moves the smokestacks away from his own home, placing them where poorer communities live. As a result, smoke thickens, water becomes polluted, seas rise, and homes are lost. Drawn from the legacy of the Industrial Revolution, the story reveals how industrialization destroys the environment and how its consequences are unevenly borne. People of lower social and economic status pay the highest price for progress they did not choose.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    <em>Good Night Giraffe</em> follows a gentle giraffe who awakens each night to travel quietly through the world. He whispers “good night” to children as they fall asleep and visits wounded animals in their natural habitats. From a baby dolphin in a polluted ocean to a child displaced by war, there is no creature he overlooks. Although the giraffe knows there are limits to what he can do, his presence offers comfort and witness. Through this tender nighttime journey of love and quiet resistance, this story provokes reflection on displacement, loss, and our shared hope for a more just world.

                                    In a dull, gray Animal Kingdom, a giraffe runs for president. He hopes to transform the land bright yellow—a color he believes represents warmth and hope. Once elected, President Giraffe remakes the city, spreading yellow across streets, factories, and homes. His “great yellow dream” grows ever larger, expanding from the nation to the universe; he even longs to fly into outer space and paint the universe yellow.

                                    Through this striking visual fable, <em>PEOPLE</em> uses color—a primal lens through which kids see the world—as a powerful metaphor for authority, conformity, and totalitarian control. This picture book invites reflection on freedom, choice, diversity, and coexistence. Accessible to young readers yet thought-provoking for adults, its message is essential for our times: a world of many colors is far richer than a world painted in only one.

                                    <em>Beyond the Page</em> introduces readers to a world in which reading itself is a crime. This book begins with the simple, familiar, and universal act of turning a page, but gradually unfolds into a story about Taiwan’s 38 years of dictatorship. A poetic introduction to Taiwan’s authoritarian past, it depicts a past in which books were censored, voices suppressed, and knowledge tightly controlled. Rendered in a magical-realist tone, <em>Beyond the Page</em> portrays the book being literally locked: only the correct key can unlock its keyhole and thus “open” the book.
                                </p>

                                    Delicate yet emotionally powerful, this book reflects on censorship, freedom, and the weight of silence. Rather than focusing on historical judgment, it highlights something deeper: the shared emotional memory carried through stories. This picture book invites readers of all ages to turn the page, confront the past, and discover that freedom cannot be taken for granted.

                                    In <em>Smokestack Story</em>, a wealthy man lives comfortably in a grand mansion surrounded by smokestacks. While the smokestacks make his life easier—they generate power that allows him to produce and consume all that he desires—the smoke they release smells foul. To solve his problem, he moves the smokestacks far from his own home, placing them where poor families live. As the smokestacks multiply, thick smoke fills the air. They pollute drinking water, raise sea levels, and trigger landslides that bury entire homes.
                                </p>

                                    Hand-drawn and told in the style of a modern fable, <em>Smokestack Story</em> reflects on the Industrial Revolution and the environmental and social crises spawned since. The story exposes how environmental damage and inequality are deeply linked: those with the fewest resources are often the first to suffer, while the wealthy continue to benefit. In this picture book, the people living in disadvantaged communities come together to eliminate the smokestacks.

                                    In <em>Good Night Giraffe</em>, a gentle and extraordinary giraffe towers above the city—so tall that he can whisper “good night” to children from the rooftops. Sleeping by day and awakening at midnight, he begins his quiet journeys in the dark, moving softly through the world to comfort those who need him most. From anxious children on the eve of life-changing journeys, to creatures of the ocean harmed by pollution, to lonely beings longing for reassurance, the Goodnight Giraffe appears only when they have just fallen asleep. With his kind words and calm presence, he promises them that they are not alone.

                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    His nocturnal travels expand beyond the city—into the sea, the mountains, and even war-torn landscapes. This story gently touches on themes of environmental destruction, war, displacement,  and the limits of kindness in healing all wounds. Poetic and compassionate, <em>Good Night Giraffe</em> is a bedtime picture book that speaks to children and adults alike, offering comfort in an uncertain world.  As readers, we learn that even though we cannot solve all problems and injustices, bringing a full presence and openness to the possibility of connection still matters.
